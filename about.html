    <p>AI is today being integrated with and deployed into a variety of sectors. There are numerous examples where AI is making an impact on the world and augmenting human capabilities in significant ways. Faculty members from diverse disciplines associated with the school work on AI and Data Science applications in basic sciences, biological sciences, environmental sciences, social sciences and different fields of engineering. School aims to make significant contributions in application fields by developing approaches aligned to the problem specific challenges.
    </p>
    <h3 id="subheading"> Locally Relevant Research</h3>
    <P>Rajasthan, as a state, has several large scale applications of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence for uplifting the local communities. For example, how AIDE can help in agriculture in the arid region? How AIDE can help in exploiting solar energy? How AIDE can assist in research on ground water management? How AIDE. can help in providing clean drinking water? How AIDE can help in preserving and flourishing local art and culture? The AIDE School will undertake interdisciplinary research projects that will be locally connected and socially relevant.

            Creating a research group to work on AI standards and Regulatory Framework <br>
            Technical standards for AI covers many issues like safety, security, accuracy, usability, interoperability and reliability of the model and data. Flexible and robust technical standards for AI are critical to the successful development and deployment of the technology. This group can work with national and international bodies to generate and implement <br>
            (a) guidelines for the design of AI systems to ensure that they can be easily integrated with other technologies, utilize best practices for security and safety, and adhere to technical specifications that maximize their utility; and <br>
            (b) common standards which can serve as mechanisms to evaluate and compare AI systems
        </li>
        <li>
            Creating a research group for working on Intellectual Property Rights of AI and DS based technologies <br>
            The growth of AI across a range of technical fields raises a number of policy questions with respect to IP. These questions include: whether the existing IP system needs to be modified to provide balanced protection for machine created works and inventions, AI itself and the data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Creating a research group for working on Ethical issues of AI <br>
            World economic forum identifies following ethical questions related to AI <br>
            (a) Unemployment. What happens as jobs disappear with introduction of AI? <br>
            (b) Inequality. How do we distribute the wealth created by machines? <br>
            (c) Humanity. How do machines affect our behaviour and interaction? <br>
            (d) Artificial stupidity. How can we guard against mistakes? <br>
            (e) Bias: How do we eliminate AI bias? <br>
            (f) Security. How do we keep AI safe from adversaries? <br>
            (g) Evil genies: How do we protect against unintended consequences? <br>
            (h) Singularity. How do we stay in control of a complex intelligent system? <br>
            (i) Robot rights. How do we define the humane treatment of AI? <br>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>We need to address these issues for analysing and assessing long term perspectives of AI and DS driven technology development.</p>
