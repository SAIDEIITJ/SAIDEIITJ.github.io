  name: Eye Tracker (Tobii Pro Fusion Screen-based)
  description: >-
    The device detects and tracks the eye movements using the pupil center
    corneal reflection (PCCR) technique. It supports multiple sampling rates up
    to 250 Hz enabling the collection of eye movement data such as fixations,
    saccades, and smooth pursuit. The device works with a software interface
    called a Tobii Pro Lab to support experiment design and data analysis.

  description: >-
    The Meta Quest Pro is a mixed reality (MR) headset developed by Reality
    Labs, a division of Meta Platforms. The headset contains internal sensors
    that are used for eye and face tracking, primarily for use with avatars. The
    Quest Pro has a thinner lens enclosure and a more visor-like form factor
    that does not obscure the entirety of the user&#8217;s peripheral vision in
    contrast to the other VR headsets. The lenses can be adjusted for
    interpupillary distance and can be moved forward and backward. The Quest Pro
    uses Touch Pro controllers, having a more compact design with upgraded
    haptics with onboard motion tracking using embedded cameras and processors.
    The controllers are also rechargeable via the headset&#8217;s charging dock.

  name: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) System (By Magstim)
  description: >-
    The Magstim Bistim2 is intended to be used for the stimulation of peripheral
    nerves and the human cortex for diagnostic purposes. The Magstim Bistim2
    consists of two units along with a connecting module that enables the output
    from two Magstim units to output into a single stimulating coil as a single
    high-energy pulse or a pair of individual spaced pulses. The TMS device is
    capable of stimulating by inducing small currents in the nerve using a brief
    pulse of electromagnetic energy. The device has proven to be useful for
    Intracortical facilitation and inhibition research
