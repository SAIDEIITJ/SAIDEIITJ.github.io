    We explore several aspects of brain function: * How does modern technology
    interact with the brain, which was designed for a very different
    environment? * Building dynamical models of the whole brain * Developing
    novel methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders * Building models of
    cognition

    Welcome to our research group!  Our research group is dedicated to pushing
    the boundaries of innovation in the fields of Robotics and Artificial
    Intelligence. With a focus on cutting-edge technologies, we explore a wide
    range of areas including Bio-inspired Mechanisms, Grippers, Tactile Sensors,
    vision sensors, Medical Robotics, Wearable Robotics and Metamorphic Drone
    Arms.  One of our primary objectives is to take research from
    conceptualization to realization. We utilize modeling, simulation, and 3D
    printing technology to develop prototypes of robots from scratch. Our
    ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between laboratory research, typically
    characterized by low Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), and market-ready
    products with high TRLs. Through our interdisciplinary approach and focus on
    practical applications, we aim to contribute to the advancement of robotics
    and AI technologies that have real-world impact.  Join us as we explore the
    exciting frontier of robotics and artificial intelligence, and work towards
    bringing innovative ideas to life.  Welcome to the future of robotics!

    My main research area, Strategic Social Choice Theory, considers situations
    where agents have private information. A collective decision has to be made
    that depends on the private information held by agents. This private
    information has therefore to be elicited or revealed by the agents. Agents
    may misreport their private information interpreting the revelation process
    as a "game". The final outcome will depend on not just their own
    announcement but the announcement of all others. This sub-field of economics
    mainly focuses on what collective goals can be achieved in these settings.

    My research interests encompass a diverse range of topics within the field
    of cognitive neuroscience, focusing primarily on understanding the intricate
    interplay between sleep, and cognition. I investigate how various factors
    such as emotion and cognition influence mental processes, utilizing
    techniques like neuromodulation and non-invasive brain stimulation to
    explore neural mechanisms. My work extends to the realm of affective
    neuroscience, where I delve into the neural underpinnings of emotions and
    their impact on cognition. Through experimental neuropsychology and EEG
    analysis, I seek to unravel the complexities of cognitive aging and
    decision-making, shedding light on how these processes evolve over the
    lifespan. Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to a deeper understanding of
    the brain and behavior, with potential implications for therapeutic
    interventions and cognitive enhancement strategies.

    In our research group, we are using both experimental and computational
    approaches for understanding fundamental as well as application-based
    problems. 1. Computational research  We are using a kinetic-theory-based
    mesoscopic simulation approach for understanding fluid flow, heat, and mass
    transfer phenomena. Recently, we are using LBM for the simulation of
    double-diffusive convection (DDC).  Our objective is to study the influence
    of the external magnetic field on flow transport and heat-mass transfer in
    different systems. Moreover, we are also investigating the complex
    interaction between the convection and magnetohydrodynamic parameters with
    the electrical conducting fluids. We are aiming to find optimized parameters
    for heat and mass transfer enhancement as well as deterioration.  2.
    Experimental research  The rapid population growth, increasing living human
    standards, and modern industrialization are subject to an increase in the
    need for energy to a considerable extent. Non-renewable energy resources are
    depleting in ascending order with increasing energy generation cost per kWh.
    On the other hand, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal,
    tidal, biomass, and biofuels are abundant. These sources can fulfil the
    world's enormous energy demand at a low cost of production without harming
    the environment. In this context, solar energy is considered a prominent
    renewable source of energy with higher availability and natural resources,
    with time-dependent limitations. It must be conserved for efficient energy
    utilization from peak hours and to reduce output fluctuations. Thermal
    energy storage (TES) is one of the efficient ways to store thermal energy
    economically and efficiently, to store solar energy during the day and
    utilize it at night. Conversely, TES with phase change material (PCM) as an
    efficient energy-storing material with more comprehensive applications in
    HVAC systems, photovoltaics, solar stills, solar collectors,
    thermo-regulating textiles and building heat recovery (Panda and Gangawane
    https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2022.117867).

    Our research interests are broadly in the areas of computing systems
    specifically in the intersection areas of systems, applications, and big
    data. We explore new techniques for system efficiency, high performance, and
    architectures that can support new data driven applications from broad areas
    of machine learning, data analytics, and computational sciences.

    Understanding the biological functions of the various protein complexes and
    their relevance to human health depends very much on having a detailed
    understanding of their structure to the atomic level. With the availability
    of a huge amount of structural data, automated methods are required to
    curate valuable information. My research group work at this interface of
    Computational and Biological Sciences where we specifically focus on
    studying genetic variations among the diverse populations and hence
    mutational robustness of proteins. The aim is to understand disease
    mechanisms in the context of protein structure (specifically protein
    quaternary structure) variation. This knowledge will be used to improve
    predictions of disease mutations, which is essential to interpreting the
    growing volumes of information on genetic variation. In our lab, we use
    diverse computational methods to do structural analysis on bulk data. This
    &#8216;big data&#8217; analysis on structural biology is anticipated to create a new
    field of &#8216;structuromics&#8217; (bridging proteomics and interactomics with
    structural data) and I foresee my research group here at IIT Jodhpur
    actively contributing to it.

    I work in the  broad area of understanding human genome structure and
    variation for its application in the discovery of biomarkers for predicting
    susceptibility to diseases, understanding human phenotypes and adaptations
    and mapping mutational histories. I have been involved in developing a new
    area of research &#8220;Ayurgenomics&#8221; that aims to integrate Ayurveda with modern
    medicine through genomics. At IITJ we have set up a unique 
    transdisciplinary initiative "Ayurtech" to develop AI enabled evidence based
    solutions for Ayurveda practices for application in integrative medicine.

    At the Baillet Lab, we explore how the brain works in real-time by studying
    its dynamic electrical activity. We use advanced imaging technologies like
    magnetoencephalography (MEG) to capture brain signals, helping us understand
    everything from basic brain functions to neurological disorders. Our goal is
    to use this knowledge to develop better tools for diagnosing and treating
    conditions like epilepsy and brain tumors. We're also passionate about open
    science, sharing our data and methods freely with the global research
    community, and collaborating with industry to bring innovative brain-imaging
    technologies into real-world use.
