    We study the impact of smartphone use on the brain, focusing on the
    relationship between smartphone use and gambling. Does smartphone addiction
    have any similarity with gambling addiction? Secondly we also explore the
    possibility of using smartphones to study cognition in a more naturalistic
    way compared to traditional lab experiments.
