    Sun Pharma Science Foundation National Symposium on &#8220;ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
    IN HEALTHCARE&#8221;

    AI has potential to be transformative for healthcare, particularly for a
    country like India with a large population, inadequate number of specialists
    and people living far from even primary healthcare facilities. However, the
    enticing promise and potential of AI in radically improving diagnostics,
    precision treatment and reduce hospital admin load has not delivered its
    promises on ground. A wide gap exists between expectations of the practicing
    doctors and what AI engineers have been able to deliver. For AI to be
    effective the AI models for India have to be built in India on data from
    Indian patients. Catalyzing a dialogue between scientists and doctors, is
    the primary objective of this one-day symposium. It will bring together
    clinicians, engineers and industry to understand where we stand in terms of
    technology and its usage, and what are the expectations and needs to fully
    realize AI&#8217;s potential. The symposium will also host panel discussions,
    where questions, misgivings, and curiosity will be addressed.
